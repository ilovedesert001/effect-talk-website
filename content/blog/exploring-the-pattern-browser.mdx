# Exploring the Pattern Browser

The pattern browser at [/patterns](/patterns) is the core of EffectTalk. It's where 300+ production-ready Effect patterns live, organized so you can find exactly what you need without scrolling through a flat list or guessing at category names.

This post walks through how to use it — search, filters, sorting, pattern cards, and the detail view. If you haven't visited the patterns page yet, open it in another tab and follow along.

## The Layout

The browser uses a two-column layout on desktop: a sidebar on the left for category filters and search, and the main area on the right for sort controls, active filters, and the pattern grid. On mobile, the sidebar stacks above the grid.

{/* TODO: Screenshot 1 — Full pattern browser page showing the sidebar with categories, the search bar, and the pattern grid with several cards visible. Desktop width. */}

At the top of the main area you'll see the total count — something like "Showing all 312 patterns" — which updates live as you apply filters.

## Search

The search bar sits at the top of the sidebar. Type anything and results update instantly — there's no submit button and no round-trip to the server. The entire pattern set is loaded once and filtered client-side, so search feels immediate.

Search matches against three fields: title, description, and tags. It's case-insensitive and matches substrings, so typing "retry" will find patterns with "retry" in the title, "retrying" in the description, or a "retry" tag. A small X button appears to clear the search when it's active.

The URL updates as you search — `?q=retry` — so you can bookmark or share a filtered view.

## Filters

Below the search bar, the sidebar shows **category** filters. Each category displays its pattern count in an orange badge. Categories are sorted by count, most patterns first, so the most useful categories are always at the top.

Click a category to filter. Click it again to deselect. When a filter is active, a "Clear all" button appears in the sidebar header to reset everything at once.

The main area has three more filter rows:

**Sort by difficulty.** Two options: "Beginner to Senior" (the default) and "Senior to Beginner." This controls the order of the pattern grid, not which patterns are shown.

**New.** Toggle between "All" and "New only." New patterns are those added in recent releases. Each button shows a count badge so you can see how many new patterns exist before clicking.

**Difficulty.** Filter to a specific level: Beginner, Intermediate, or Senior. Each button shows its count. Like category, this is a toggle — click to select, click again to show all.

All filters compose. You can search for "stream," filter to the Concurrency category, set difficulty to Intermediate, and sort senior-first. The result count updates to show "Showing 4 of 312 patterns" (or whatever the numbers are). Every filter state is reflected in the URL as query parameters, so the full state is shareable and bookmarkable.

{/* TODO: Screenshot 2 — Pattern browser with active filters applied: a category selected in the sidebar, a difficulty level selected, and a search term entered. The result count should show something like "Showing N of 312 patterns." */}

## Pattern Cards

Each pattern in the grid is a card. Cards are dense by design — the goal is to show enough information that you can decide whether to click through without reading the full pattern.

From top to bottom, a card shows:

**Badges.** Up to three: a green "New" badge if the pattern was recently added, a purple difficulty badge (Beginner, Intermediate, or Senior), and a blue category badge. These match the filter options, so you can visually scan the grid and confirm your filters are working.

**Title.** The pattern name, linked to the detail page.

**Description.** A one-line summary, truncated if it's long.

**Goal.** If the pattern content includes a Goal, Rationale, or Key Insight section, the card extracts and displays it — clamped to two lines. This is the "why should I care" line.

**Code previews.** This is the most useful part of the card. If the pattern has a "Pattern" section (the good way) and an "Anti-Pattern" section (the bad way), the card shows both side by side with syntax highlighting. The pattern code gets a green left border; the anti-pattern gets a red one. If the pattern only has a single code example, that's shown instead. You get a real preview of the code before you click.

**Tags.** At the bottom, outlined tag badges for topics like "error-handling," "concurrency," "streams," and so on.

The entire card is clickable. Hover gives a subtle shadow lift. On keyboard navigation, a focus ring appears.

## The Detail View

Click a card and you land on the full pattern page at `/patterns/{id}`. The detail view shows the complete pattern content: description, all code blocks with syntax highlighting, and the full prose explanation.

The header shows the same badges as the card (New, category, difficulty) plus the full title and description. Below that, the rendered pattern content uses clean typography with proper code highlighting.

{/* TODO: Screenshot 3 — A single pattern detail page showing the title, badges, description, and at least one syntax-highlighted code block. Pick a pattern that has both a "Pattern" and "Anti-Pattern" section if possible. */}

If you arrived from a guided tour lesson, the back button at the top takes you back to exactly where you were — the correct lesson and step. Otherwise it links back to the tour index.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of It

**Start with difficulty.** If you're new to Effect, filter to Beginner and sort Beginner-first. Work through those before moving up. The difficulty levels are meaningful — Beginner patterns use core Effect concepts, Intermediate patterns introduce composition and services, and Senior patterns deal with advanced concurrency, resource management, and architecture.

**Use search for problem-solving.** When you're stuck on a specific problem — retry logic, resource cleanup, error channels — type the problem into search rather than browsing categories. The tag and description matching usually surfaces the right pattern faster than navigating the category tree.

**Bookmark filtered views.** Because the URL reflects all filter state, you can bookmark useful views. A link like `/patterns?difficulty=intermediate&category=Error%20Handling` takes you straight to intermediate error handling patterns every time.

**Look at the anti-patterns.** Many cards show both the Effect way and the non-Effect (or naive) way side by side. The anti-patterns are just as educational as the patterns — they show you what to avoid and why the Effect approach is better.

## What's Next

The pattern library isn't static. We're adding patterns regularly — particularly in areas like testing strategies, streaming, and metrics. New patterns get the green "New" badge so you can find them quickly with the "New only" filter.
