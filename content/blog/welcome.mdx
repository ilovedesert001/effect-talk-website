# Welcome to EffectTalk

Most programming frameworks promise simplicity. Effect does something harder: it promises _composability_. You get type-safe errors, structured concurrency, dependency injection, and resource management — all in one coherent system. The trade-off is that Effect has a genuine learning curve. Not because the ideas are bad, but because they're unfamiliar. There's no prior art in TypeScript that looks quite like this.

EffectTalk exists because of that gap.

## Everything Is an Effect

The name is a nod to Smalltalk, the language that organized everything around a single concept: _everything is an object_. Messages, numbers, control flow — all objects, all the way down. That uniformity made Smalltalk strange at first and powerful forever after.

Effect does the same thing for TypeScript, but the organizing concept is the _effect_. An HTTP request is an effect. A database query is an effect. Reading a config file, logging a message, retrying a failed operation — all effects. They compose the same way. They fail the same way. They get tested the same way.

Once you internalize this, your code gets dramatically simpler. Not because you're writing less of it, but because every piece works with every other piece. You stop inventing ad-hoc patterns for error handling, retries, timeouts, and resource cleanup. You just use the one pattern that already works.

The problem is getting from "I've read the docs" to "I can build production systems." That's the gap EffectTalk is designed to close.

## What EffectTalk Is

EffectTalk is a pattern library, learning platform, and consulting practice for Effect developers. It's built for people who have decided to use Effect in production and need concrete, copy-and-study examples — not toy demos, not theoretical explanations, but patterns extracted from real codebases that solve real problems.

## What's Inside Today

Here's what's live right now:

- **300+ production-ready patterns** at [/patterns](/patterns). Filterable by category, difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Senior), and tags. Full-text search. Sortable by difficulty. Each pattern includes working code you can study, adapt, and use.

- **Guided tours** at [/tour](/tour). Five structured learning paths — Fundamentals, Composition, Concurrency, Data & I/O, and Validation. Each tour walks you through interactive steps with code examples. Sign in with GitHub and your progress is saved automatically.

- **GitHub authentication**. Sign in with your GitHub account via [WorkOS](https://workos.com). This unlocks saved tour progress and API key management. No email lists, no marketing databases.

- **Consulting** at [/consulting](/consulting). Three engagement types: Effect Assessment (evaluate whether Effect fits your team and codebase), Migration Strategy (plan and execute a move to Effect), and Developer Training (get your team productive with Effect). These are real engagements, not landing pages.

## Coming Soon

We're building four more tools:

- **CLI Tool** — Effect patterns and utilities from your terminal
- **MCP Server** — Integrate Effect pattern search into AI-assisted development workflows
- **Code Review and Refactoring** — Automated analysis of your Effect code with improvement suggestions
- **V3 to V4 Migration** — Tooling to help you upgrade between Effect major versions

These are in active development. When they ship, you'll hear about it here.

## Why This Exists

The Effect documentation is good and getting better. The Discord is active and helpful. So why build another thing?

Because documentation tells you what the API _does_. Patterns show you what to _build with it_.

When you're staring at a production codebase and need to figure out how to compose three services that each need their own error channel, retry policy, and resource lifecycle — the docs give you the primitives and the type signatures. What you actually need is a worked example from someone who has done it before.

That's the difference between a reference and a curriculum. Between knowing the grammar of a language and knowing how to write well in it.

There's also a vocabulary problem. Effect introduces concepts — fibers, layers, scopes, services, schedules — that don't have direct analogs in typical TypeScript code. Teams adopting Effect need a shared vocabulary and shared patterns. When everyone on the team can look at a pattern and say "that's the Service pattern with scoped resources," you stop having long design discussions about things that are already solved.

EffectTalk is an attempt to build that shared vocabulary, one pattern at a time.

## What's Next

Near-term, we're focused on three things:

1. **More patterns.** The library currently covers the most common production scenarios, but there are gaps — particularly around testing strategies, streaming, and metrics. We'll keep adding patterns as we encounter and solve new problems.

2. **More tours.** The five current tour groups cover Effect's core, but there's room for tours on specific domains: building HTTP APIs, working with databases, integrating with existing Node.js codebases.

3. **CLI and MCP.** Getting Effect patterns into your editor and your terminal, where you actually need them. These are the next two tools to ship.

We're not trying to build a framework or a platform play. We're building a reference library for people who write Effect code. The measure of success is simple: when you're stuck on an Effect problem, EffectTalk should be the fastest way to get unstuck.

## Get Started

Two places to start:

- **Browse the patterns** at [/patterns](/patterns). Filter by your current skill level and explore what's there. The search works well — try typing whatever you're trying to build.

- **Take a tour** at [/tour](/tour). Start with Fundamentals if you're new to Effect, or jump to Concurrency or Data & I/O if you already have the basics down.

If you find a pattern that's wrong, missing, or confusing, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/PaulJPhilp/EffectPatterns). This is a living library. It gets better when people use it and tell us what's missing.

Welcome to EffectTalk. Let's build something.
